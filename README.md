*Hello! I'm Seher*

A final-year Computer Science student with a passion for building innovative applications. I'm proficient in:

HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Java, jQuery, PHP, MERN Stack, and WordPress

I share my projects here on GitHub, and I'm continuously learning and improving my skills. I'm excited to connect with like-minded developers and explore opportunities to collaborate and grow.

*Let's connect!*

Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn or via email. I'd love to discuss projects, ideas, or just chat about tech!
